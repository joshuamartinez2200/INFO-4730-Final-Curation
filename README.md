# INFO-4730-Final-Curation
Repository for Final Project in Digital Preservation and Curation Course INFO 4730 at the University of North Texas.  

This repository was created to preserve the continuity for my position I held as Special Projects Officer for my Air Force ROTC Detachment during the Spring 2018 semester. The repository will hold data that outlines the duties, responsibilities, and expectations of the job. This curation will catalog the data necessary for the next occupant to fulfill the role.
